==========

WireDiff is a debugging tool to diff network traffic leveraging
Wireshark.

Wirediff lets you open 2 network traces packets side-by-side. You can
select a packet from each trace and diff their content at the protocol
level you want.

This is a rewrite of an older tool smbcmp [1] made more generic
(smbcmp only dealt with SMB traffic).

WireDiff is licensed under the GPLv3 and originally written by
Aur√©lien Aptel <aurelien.aptel@gmail.com>. See LICENSE for more
